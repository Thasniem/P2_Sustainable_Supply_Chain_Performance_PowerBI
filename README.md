# Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Using PowerBI
## Overview  
The **Sustainable Supply Chain Performance** project focuses on analyzing and optimizing supply chain data to improve decision-making and operational efficiency. The dataset used in this project contains key metrics related to product details, supplier information, manufacturing processes, logistics, and transportation. By leveraging **Power BI**, data was transformed and structured to gain actionable insights into supply chain performance.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **data-driven analysis** can help businesses enhance supply chain efficiency, minimize costs, improve lead times, and support sustainability initiatives.  

## Dataset Information  
The dataset consists of **23 columns**, covering various aspects of the supply chain:  
- **Product Information**: SKU, product type, pricing, availability, and sales performance.  
- **Inventory & Logistics**: Stock levels, lead times, order quantities, shipping details, and associated costs.  
- **Manufacturing Data**: Production volumes, lead times, costs, inspection results, and defect rates.  
- **Supplier & Transportation Details**: Supplier names, locations, transportation modes, and route information.  

By analyzing these data points, organizations can **identify inefficiencies, optimize resource allocation, and streamline supply chain operations**.  

## Data Transformation Process  
The dataset was **imported into Power BI** and transformed through the following steps:  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Unnecessary columns were removed, and relevant data points were structured for analysis.  
2. **Filtering & Optimization**: The data was refined to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. **Visualization & Insights**: Power BI tools were used to generate meaningful insights into supply chain performance.  

## Key Highlights  
- **Tools Used**: Power BI for data transformation, analysis, and visualization.
